# The following is a map with supplemental key mappings for the linux console.
# Using these mappings will allow distinction between key presses for several
# keys with and without control and shift modifiers.

# These mappings can be loaded with the loadkeys(1) program. Simply run
#   loadkeys supplemental.kmap
# as root to add these mappings to your console. How to make these changes
# permanent depends on your distribution. There are also two ways to make these
# changes permanent: create a keymap which contains this file, or add a job
# which is run on startup and executes the above loadkeys command.

# Debian (or Debian based such as Ubuntu):
#   Add the contents of this file to /etc/console-setup/remap.inc and run
#   "dpkg-reconfigure -u keyboard-configuration" as root. Adding the mappings
#   to the remap.inc file will ensure that the mappings are activated, even if
#   another keyboard layout is chosen at a later time.
